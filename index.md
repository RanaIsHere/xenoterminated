        <h2> Game: </h2>
        <p> From Earth, you ascended into the heavens with advanced technology. They realized that the other planets are filled with similar life to Earth, except one. A different         planet, filled with life, biology, physics unfamiliar to our own. You are just a high-ranked soldier in charge of the troops, but you were discharged and demoted to a mere         cleanser to cleanse a Different Planet of its life and change it to something familiar. </p>
